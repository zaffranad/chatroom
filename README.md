# Chatroom Backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zaffranad/chatroom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zaffranad/chatroom)

## A chat in a room

Chatroom is a place to chat, gossip, say good or bad things... it's simply an app you can install, deploy on a server, allowing people to connect on it and talk together

This is the backend, serving a REST API, build with Spring Boot 2 and Kotlin.

## Run and Watch!

While you're at the root of the repository:

`npm run serve`

This will start the application on port 4200 (default)... or run the following to use a different port:

`ng serve --watch --open`

## Wanna deploy?

Having fun with this app, if you want to build and deploy:

`ng build --prod`

## Continuous Integration

A automated build is configured on Travis CI (hey, look the nice badge at the top of this page!).

The configuration is located in the travis.yml file at the root of the project.
